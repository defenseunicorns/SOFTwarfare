# SOFTwarfare & Defense Unicorns Collaboration

## Project Introduction

Defense Unicorns, in strategic partnership with SOFTwarfare, initiated a one-year project on September 22, 2023. This venture is dedicated to delivering a proof-of-concept and feasibility assessment for implementing a biometric capability within the Project Blue Mission Environment (PBME) and potentially extending it to other mission environments affiliated with the Navy’s Columbia class submarine program executed by the Navy’s PMS 397.

* Defense Unicorns: As the project manager, platform architect and integration expert, Defense Unicorns will oversee the strategic design, development, and integration of the biometric capability, ensuring it aligns with the specific requirements of PBME and PMS 397.
* SOFTwarfare: Specializing in producing biometric applications, supporting infrastructure, and software bundling, SOFTwarfare will focus on customizing and optimizing biometric solutions to be seamlessly deployable into network-limited environments.# SOFTwarfare
